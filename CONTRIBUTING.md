# Introduction
This file outlines the needed information and guidelines to be a successful contributor to this repository. If you would like a more detailed view of any of the topics below, please don't hesitate to contact us by Email or by creating an issue.

# Issues
Issues are a fundamental portion of GitHub, and it is important that they are formatted correctly. When creating an issue, generally follow a few guidelines, such as being detailed and including screenshots. Previous to submitting any form of issue, please be sure that it hasn't been previously opened by another contributor.

## Bugs
Bug reporting is an essential portion of a thriving repository, and correctly stating information helps to speed up the process of resolving issues. The bug request template found on our repository gives a quick and easy method for bug reporting. If your issue does not fit the requirements of the template, be sure to include lots of information. Take screenshots, code snippets, and whatever else may help your issue. In addition to these steps, labeling what your issue type is, in this case a bug, will drastically help to speed up the resolution of your issue.

## Features
Feature requests are extremely important to have a continuously improving product. When you are writing a feature request, be sure to include as much information as possible. One simple paragraph will help to delineate your enhancement, but concrete ideas need to have a large amount of information associated with them. include pictures, prototype code snippets, and whatever else is needed to convey your point, in addition to correctly labeling your issue as **"Enhancement"**. Not all feature requests will be placed into the final stable release, but we will almost always try out your idea.

## Questions
Questions are fundamental for our community to understand the depth of this project. When posting a question, it is crucial that you look for possible solutions to your problem before posting an issue. Some simple troubleshooting issues can be solved by looking at the attached Wiki page. If you cannot find a solution to your problem, still be sure to attach sources you have reviewed in case information needs updating. Don't forget to add the **"Question"** label before submitting your issue, as it helps us prioritize issues.

# Pull Requests
Pull requests should be formatted similarly to the issue types stated above. Since templates are not currently available on our repository it is even more imperative that these rules be followed for an overall clear and concise request. When creating a pull request, highlight all of the changed files within the branch being merged. Elaborate on why these changes are important, if there could be any issues in the future, and how continuous integration software responds to the changes. Also be sure to add a reviewer to each pull request you create, which ensures that your files are ready to be merged.

# Commits
Commits are the most fundamental and important portion of GitHub. When writing a commit, a few critical steps must be followed. For example, the title of the commit should be simple and to the point, explaining exactly what has changed with the file. The description should have detailed information, such as dependency changes or additional changes that will be required in the future.

# License information

# Governance
This repository works similarly to most others on GitHub, being governed as three tiers: Users, Contributors, and Maintainers. Each has different permissions, roles, and expectations, as illustrated below.

## Users
Users are the largest portion of the community of most repositories. Users are able to freely view and download code, however since they are not a contributor they are not able to edit any code within the repository. Anybody can be a user without any previous verification.

## Contributors
Contributors are a small selection of the overall userbase of this repository. Contributors canedit code indirectly, by creating separate branches for possible new ideas. Contributors need to formally ask (via Email) to join the repository before they are allowed to edit code. In addition to this, any contributor who does not follow the Code of Conduct will have repercussions.

## Maintainers
Maintainers are the smallest yet most important subsidiary of repositories. They can manage everything within the repository, from editing files on the master branch to changing user permissions. The amount of maintainers is fixed in this repository, and there is no method for becoming one unless you have worked as a contributor successfully for multiple years. In that case, you will automatically be considered a contributor.

# Support
Support information can be found in the _"Support"_ section of the README.md file. For the most efficient support, please submit an issue with your information. For more complicated support, please reach us by Email.
